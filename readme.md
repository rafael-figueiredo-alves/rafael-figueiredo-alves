<a name="About"><img src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/about.png"></a><br>

<p align="justify">Hi, there! My name's Rafael de Figueiredo Alves. I'm a 37-year-old father of two children: my daughter Rafaela and my son Davi. I've been an English teacher for about 15 years, most of them at CCAA. Now I'd like to become a software developer. I've been studying really hard to become a great developer. I've been learning and working with <b>Delphi</b> since I was 12 years old. Recently, I've been studying a lot of stuff related to <b>HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript</b> and I'm really into <b>ReactJS</b> now.</p>

<p align="justify">My wife and kids are the secret of my success because they are the reason to keep me going and learning everything about computer programming.</p>

<p align="justify">I haven't worked as developer yet, but I've developed a lot of kinds of softwares on my own and I also developed some solutions to the place (CCAA) where I worked for almost 13 years. I developed spreadsheets to help my workplace, as I did by developing some pieces of software using Delphi. The goal of all the softwares and solutions I developed was to help automate the processes at my workplace.</p> 

<a name="Languages"><img src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/languages.png"></a><br>

<p align="justify">Here are some of the programming languages I've been learning and I've also been working with:</p>

<img id="Delphi" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/delphi.png"> <img id="Lazarus" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/lazarus.png"> <img id="Python" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/Python.png"> <img id="HTML5" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/HTML5.png">
<img id="CSS3" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/CSS3.png"> <img id="JavaScript" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/JavaScript.png"> <img id="Bootstrap" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/Bootstrap.png"> <img id="ReactJS" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/ReactJS.png">

<p align="justify">I've been learning <b>Delphi</b> and working with it since I was 12 years old. At that time, my brother brought home a CD with Delphi 2 and I immediatelly fell in love with the language. Easy and powerfull, I've developed a lot of kinds of solutions on it: from a mobile to-do like app to a sofisticated software to evaluate teachers that presents questions randomly and collects voice from the candidates and lets the people from the teaching department have a sample of their English skills. I developed solutions for Windows and Android, but I can develop stuff for iOS and MacOS too. The only reason I didn't do it was because I don't have an Apple computer and I don't have an iPhone either.</p>

<p align="justify">I want to learn <b>Lazarus</b> and I plan to work with it as well as with Delphi. It's a powerfull language that can make apps for a lot of platforms, just like Delphi. In addition to Lazarus, I really have plans to learn <b>Python</b> and integrate it to Delphi to make a great solution.</p>

<p align="justify">Recently, I've been studying <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and I got really into <b>ReactJS</b>. I can see how powerfull this knowledge can be to my future. I'm investing time making stuff with these technologies and I plan to use them as much as I can.</p>

<a name="Tools"><img src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/tools.png"></a><br>

<p align="justify">I've used and learned a really huge set of tools that I used at my work as an English teacher and a digital marketing agent. I surely have plans to use them now that I'll be a software developer. Let me show them in categories.</p>

# Office

<img id="Excel" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/excel.png"> <img id="Word" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/word.png"> <img id="PowerPoint" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/powerpoint.png"> <img id="Access" src="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/rafael-figueiredo-alves/blob/main/Images/en/Access.png">

<p align="justify">I simply love working with Excel, Word and PowerPoint. I made a lot of great spreadsheets on Excel while I worked at CCAA. Some were to help me and other teachers keep track on students grades and performance, and others were to help my coordinators and directors manage the school more effectively. I have a repository called <b><a href="https://github.com/rafael-figueiredo-alves/Excel-VBA">Excel-VBA</a></b> where I've got some of the spreadsheets and other stuff I made for the school I worked for.</p>
